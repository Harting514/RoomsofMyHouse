## Rooms of My Dream House
#### by Yik Hung


### Overview
This is Yik's house that people can visit by clicking arrow buttons to interactive among 6 rooms. 
This project was inspired by a flash game that was very popular in China during my childhood. 
I made this project based on the operation methods of this game (such as clicking on items to view). 
This project is dedicated to the memory of my childhood.


### How it works
I uses the functions such as preload(), setup(), draw(), image() and anothers to illustrate adobe XD's work to p5.js
